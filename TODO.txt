Day 11:
    Remove numpy (collects rows with all zeros another way)
    Optimise - remove the grid entirely?
    Optimise - write better adjusted difference func?
    Optimise - calculating adjusted distances from each galaxy to origin, rather than directly between pairs?

Day 10:
    Finish pt 2 (scanning left to right and toggling inside/outside:
                    Where 2* vertical pipes flip, where 2*horiztonal tiles don't flip, when horizontal U or V shape don't flip, where horizontal S shape then flip)

Day 9:
    Optimise pt2 - implement alternating differences along left side, rather than reverse and rerun pt1

Day 5:
    Optimise: cleanup/dedup any overlaps between seed ranges - might be quicker?

Day 3:
    Figure out how to beat Dan
